# C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Description
This project is part of the **ALU Low Level Programming** curriculum.  
It introduces and strengthens understanding of **pointers**, **arrays**, and **strings** in the C programming language.  
By completing this project, we learn how memory is accessed and manipulated directly, and how strings and arrays work internally.
