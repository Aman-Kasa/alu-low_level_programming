# Hello World Project

This project contains the `0-preprocessor` script, which is part of the Low-Level Programming curriculum at ALX.  

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to learn how to use the **C preprocessor**. The script `0-preprocessor` takes a C file, runs it through the **preprocessor**, and saves the output to a file called `c`.  

This project helps you understand:

- How the C preprocessor works (`#include`, `#define`, etc.)  
- How to write **Bash scripts** that interact with C files  
- Basic automation for compiling C code  

## Files

- `0-preprocessor` → Bash script that preprocesses a C file  
- `main.c` → Sample C file used to test the script  
- `README.md` → This file  
- `../Readme-image/cisfun.png` → Screenshot of the script output  

## Usage

1. Set the C file you want to preprocess:  

```bash
export CFILE=main.c
